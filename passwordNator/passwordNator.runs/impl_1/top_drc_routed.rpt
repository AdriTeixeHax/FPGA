2. REPORT DETAILS

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-11#1 Warning
CONFIG_VOLTAGE with HR Config Banks  
Unable to determine configuration voltage for configuration Bank 14. When multi-function configuration banks are being used for configuration Vivado must be able to determine the configuration voltage to be used. Using PERSIST or EMCCLK implies that a multi-function configuration bank is being used. If this is not the case, please do not use these settings. Otherwise, if the bank is being used for configuration, please use set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE [current_design] to indicate the voltage to be used.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fsm_inst/ce_attempt_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fsm_inst/ce_attempt_reg_i_2/O, cell fsm_inst/ce_attempt_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fsm_inst/ce_password_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fsm_inst/ce_password_reg_i_2/O, cell fsm_inst/ce_password_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fsm_inst/reset_password_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fsm_inst/reset_password_reg_i_2/O, cell fsm_inst/reset_password_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
